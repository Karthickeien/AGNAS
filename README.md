## Development Tools

### RC Signal Testing Tools
The project includes specialized tools for RC signal testing and validation:

1. **Single Channel Tester**
```python
# Initialize GPIO for single channel
pi.set_mode(GPIO_PIN, pigpio.INPUT)
pi.set_pull_up_down(GPIO_PIN, pigpio.PUD_DOWN)

# Callback for precise timing
def callback_function(GPIO_PIN, level, tick):
    if level == 1:  # rising edge
        start_time = tick
    elif level == 0:  # falling edge
        pulse_duration = pigpio.tickDiff(start_time, tick)
        print(f"PWM pulse duration: {pulse_duration} us")
```

2. **Multi-Channel Signal Processor**
```python
# Initialize multiple GPIO pins
GPIO_PINS = [17, 27, 22, 23, 24, 25]
pulse_durations = {pin: 0 for pin in GPIO_PINS}

# Process multiple channels
def servo_spin(pwm_signals):
    pwm_values = list(pwm_signals.values())
    if valid_signal_range(pwm_values):
        return pwm_values
```
